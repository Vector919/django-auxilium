About
=====

Django Auxilium is a set of utilities packages as a Django app which
help working in Django. The word Auxilium means help in Latin.
How this project came about is because I used to have an app for each
of my Django projects called ``data_structures`` where I kept all of my
utility methods and classes, but after doing a couple of projects,
maintaining the same folder within all of the project became non-productive,
hence I refactored it into a separate reusable package.
